# src/ is a source code folder. It holds all your Python files that contain the actual logic of your project.
# This makes the project more structured and professional.


# This file doesnâ€™t need any content (leave it empty).
#
# It tells Python that src/ is a package, allowing us to import its files like this:
#
# python
# Copy
# Edit
# from src.data_loader import load_data
# from src.model import train_model
# Why is this useful?
# It allows us to use src/ as a module, preventing import errors.
